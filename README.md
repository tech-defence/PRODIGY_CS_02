# Image Encryption Tool

This is a simple image encryption and decryption tool using basic pixel manipulation techniques. It allows users to apply a mathematical operation to the pixels of an image, thereby encrypting or decrypting the image using a secret key. The tool can handle various image types (grayscale, RGB, and RGBA).

## Features

- Encrypt images by modifying pixel values using a predefined key.
- Decrypt previously encrypted images using the same key.
- Supports grayscale, RGB, and RGBA images.
- Simple command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use.

## Requirements

Before you start, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` library (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install Pillow
